      <h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SKYLINE</h2>
      <p>
        The legendary Skyline, first introduced in 1957, was originally built by
        Japan's Prince Motor Company. Production of the Prince Skyline lasted
        from 1957 until 1966, when Prince and Nissan merged. With humble origins
        as a rather modest 4-door luxury car, the Skyline began to evolve into a
        performance-bred sportscar following the merger. Today the Skyline is
        most recognized as the influential predecessor to the modern GT-R.

      <h3>THE FIRST SKYLINE</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="p3">
      <p>
        The Nissan Skyline was originally produced by the Prince Motor Company
        in 1957, and then by Nissan (becoming the 'Nissan Skyline') after the
        two companies merged in 1966. The Skyline was available as either a
        four-door sedan or a five-door station wagon, and it featured a 1.5L
        GA-30 engine. It wasn't until 1964 that the first racing GT Skyline was
        introduced, still under the Prince Motors flag. The introduction of the
        GT Skyline marked the Skyline's shift from sedan to race car.

      <h3>THE FIRST GENERATION NISSAN SKYLINE</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="p3">
      <p>
        Skyline finally became a Nissan in 1969, when the first performance-bred
        Skyline GT-R was unveiled at the Tokyo Motor Show. It was still a sedan,
        but it now boasted an inline six engine and (impressive for the day) 160
        horsepower. The first generation Nissan Skyline was available from
        1969-1972.
        <br />The 1969 GT-R version of the Skyline was a touring car like no
        other. Taking cues from the Nissan Prince R380 racing prototype, it
        relied on a four-valve Dual Overhead Cam engine for power and four-wheel
        independent suspension for its remarkable handling. The car obliterated
        the competition in Japan's domestic touring races, winning 52 races in
        its first three years of competition. <br />The first two-door version
        was introduced in 1970 with a successful launch and was well-received,
        but a global gasoline crisis and a move towards stricter emissions
        standards put the Skyline GT-R on the shelf for a time.

      <h3>R30 SKYLINE</h3>
      <h3>R31 SKYLINE</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="p3">
      <p>
        From 1973 to 1977, the C110 generation Skyline was produced, known as
        the Kenmari thanks to the commercial with owners named Ken and Mary. It
        too had a GT-R version but only for 1973, which would make it the last
        GT-R branded Skyline until 1989.
      </p>

      <p>
        The R30 was a successful and remarkably versatile design, available as a
        coupe, four-door sedan, five-door hatchback, and a four-door wagon. All
        told, the R30 was available in 26 variations, none of them really
        hinting at what the Skyline would one day become.
      </p>

      <p>
        1986 saw the introduction of the R31. It was a little bigger and boxier
        than previous models, and was the first to get the famous "Red Top"
        Skyline FJ20 engine with red cam covers and the Nissan Induction Control
        System.

      <h3>THE R32 SKYLINE GT-R</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="p3">
      <p>
        The Skyline had been through many phases, but it was in 1989 that the
        real precursor to the GT-R of today was introduced. The R32 Skyline GT-R
        had all-wheel drive and the famed Nissan RB26DETT inline six engine that
        pumped out 280 horsepower. It still wasn't sold in America, but the JDM
        (Japanese Domestic Market) model was and still is a legend in the
        American tuner community.<br />A stripped-down version of the R32
        entered the Japanese Touring Car Championship in 1989 and won every race
        it started—29 in a row—over the next four seasons. It was then that the
        legend of the GT-R was truly born.

      <p>
        After first appearing to the motoring world as a prototype at the Tokyo
        Motor Show in 1993, the R33 Skyline GT-R was finally launched to the
        public in January 1995 again with the famed RB26DETT.<br />In its
        evolution from the R32, the R33 Skyline GT-R became a faster, more
        stable car, thanks to highly improved body stiffness, better weight
        distribution and optimized traction control provided by the new
        all-wheel drive system called “ATTESA E-TS PRO”.

    <div>
      <h3>THE R34 SKYLINE GT-R</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="p3">
      <p>
        The R34 Skyline GT-R was introduced in 1998, and was available from 1998
        to 2002. A technologically advanced display unit set the model apart,
        while it's RB26DETT twin-turbo I6 engine produced impressive horsepower.
        The shorter wheelbase and more streamlined body of the R34 helped it to
        achieve even higher performance than its predecessors.

      <p>
        In 2008, the GT-R officially landed on American roads. Nissan dropped
        the Skyline name and added a twin-turbo V6 that put out 473 horsepower,
        propelling the GT-R to performance levels that could not only compete
        with, but outclass legendary American muscle cars as well as German and
        Italian supercars. Overnight, the GT-R became a legend. Its
        technologically advanced road-grabbing all-wheel drive provided
        exhilarating handling, and it was all wrapped up in a sleek, yet
        muscular, modern exterior design.

        Making its debut at the 2019 New York International Auto Show, the 2020
        Nissan GT-R 50th Anniversary Edition took the nameplate to a level that
        was unimaginable when it was first introduced 50 years ago. To celebrate
        the half-century of the GT-R, engineers challenged themselves to find
        undiscovered performance potential while still making sure the car could
        be enjoyed by drivers at any level.

      <p>
        One year after its worldwide 50th anniversary celebration in 2020, the
        legendary<a href="">Nissan GT-R</a>returned for 2021 with its high
        performance and unparalleled refinement firmly on display.<br />

        The GT-R T-Spec stands apart as an instant collectible with exclusive
        colors first seen on the Nissan Skyline GT-R R34. Also with gold-painted
        NISMO forged wheels and wider front fenders to accommodate forged
        20-inch wheels, this special edition proves to be a rare sight.

      <h3>GT-R NISMO SPECIAL EDITION</h3>
      <p>
        In 2020, the car's engineers incorporated new turbochargers that now
        help the GT-R Nismo produce 600-horsepower. The change also helped
        increase the engine's low rpm response providing tighter clearances and
        a 5% increase in efficiency. The result was even sharper engine response
        in and out of corners, making the driving experience more rewarding and
        richer than ever before.<br />

        The GT-R NISMO Special Edition proves that beauty is more than skin deep
        with this unique carbon-fiber hood with clear paint. Inspired by the R34
        Skyline GT-R V-spec II N1, it not only looks amazing, it saves precious
        grams of weight. [*]

      <h3>FROM SKYLINE TO GT-R: THE ENGINE</h3>
      <p>
        The first Skyline engine, introduced by the Prince Motor Company in
        1957, was a 1.5-litre 4-cylinder power plant that produced 60
        horsepower. Yes, 60 horsepower.

        <br />Fast-forward to 1988, when Nissan introduced a new RB26DETT engine
        with the R32 Skyline GT-R. This powerful (at the time) 2.6-L twin-turbo
        was capable of producing 280 PS (162 kW; 276 hp) and had 271 ln-ft of
        torque.

        <br />Things have continued to change. Today, the GT-R's engine pumps
        out nearly 600 horsepower - about 10X as much as the original Prince
        engine. To understand what the modern Nissan GT-R is all about, you just
        have to lift the hood. The engine you'll see is not a gas-guzzling
        behemoth, but a remarkable piece of advanced technology generating power
        from a 3.8-litre twin-turbo V6. When a GT-R is being built at our
        facility in Yokohama, Japan, we don't let just anyone assemble the
        engine.

      <h3>THE TAKUMI</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="p3">
      <p>
        Just four men are trusted with the task of building the GT-R's engine,
        and they are called "The Takumi". Roughly translated, Takumi means
        "master craftsman" in English, and master craftsmen they most certainly
        are. Combined, they have more than a century of experience, and when
        they finish building, by hand, a GT-R engine, they literally put their
        name on their work. A special plaque is mounted on each engine,
        displaying the name of the man who built it.

      <h3>THE GT-R IN POPULAR CULTURE</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="h2">
      <p>
        A car—a supercar—like the GT-R tends to draw a lot of attention, and
        over the years it has popped up in places other than the road. Several
        GT-R models have appeared in the ongoing video game series Need For
        Speed. Both the GT-R and Skyline are featured in the wildly popular Fast
        and Furious movie franchise. Dozens of different versions of the GT-R
        appear in the revolutionary driving simulator/game Gran Turismo as a
        virtual car, the response was so enthusiastic that a real concept car
        was built.

      <h3>2021 NISSAN GT-R®</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="p3">
      <p>
        Question everything. Get better answers. GT-R rewrites the laws of
        sports car aerodynamics, redefines supercar performance, and gives you
        4-season thrills. 4 seats, and a handcrafted interior. Mid-engine
        exotics, you've been warned. This is tech that breaks rules and shatters
        records. This is tech that moves.

      <h3>2020 NISSAN 370Z®</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="p3">
      <p>
        From the battle cry of a legendary 332-hp, VQ V6, to the world's-first
        available rev-matching manual transmission. The relentless cornering
        grip of a dynamically balanced chassis talking to you through a
        driver-focused cockpit. But it's more than just carbon fiber composite
        and 19" forged alloy wheels - it has soul. The 2020 Nissan 370Z. Pure
        exhilaration from A to Z, this is tech that moves.
